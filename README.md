# Metastatic-tissue-identifier-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The problem statement was tasked to detect cancer by identifying metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph nodes using Deep Learning. We created an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.
